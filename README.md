# Prionmodeling
Phenomenological modeling of Prion Protein aggregation combined with Molecular Dynamics
1 Introduction
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), also known as prion diseases, are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that affect both humans and animals. These diseases are characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of the normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) into a pathogenic isoform called PrPSC. The accumulation of PrPSC in the brain leads to the formation of microscopic holes, giving the tissue a sponge-like appearance, hence the term "spongiform" in the name of these diseases. Some notable examples of prion diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) in humans, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, and Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in deer and elk. (Benestad & Telling, 2018)
In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the potential rise of TSEs in human populations.(Hannaoui, Schatzl, & Gilch, 2017) This concern is driven by several factors, including increased proximity to wildlife, climate change, and other environmental and societal changes. As human populations continue to expand and encroach upon natural habitats, the risk of exposure to animal prion diseases, such as CWD, is becoming more significant. CWD, which affects deer, elk, and moose, has been spreading rapidly across North America and has recently been detected in Europe. The potential for CWD to cross the species barrier and infect humans is a major concern, as highlighted by recent studies showing that CWD can be transmitted to non-human primates under experimental conditions.(Pearson, 2020) Climate change is another factor that may contribute to the rise of TSEs in humans.(Kutz, Hoberg, Molnár, Dobson, & Verocai, 2014) As temperatures rise and weather patterns become more extreme, the distribution and migration patterns of wildlife populations are likely to change. This could lead to increased contact between humans and animals carrying prion diseases, as well as the emergence of new prion strains adapted to changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, climate change may also affect the stability and persistence of prion proteins in the environment, potentially increasing the risk of exposure to infectious prions. Other factors, such as globalization, international trade, and changes in agricultural practices, may also play a role in the spread of TSEs. The globalization of food supply chains has the potential to introduce prion-contaminated products into new regions, as exemplified by the spread of BSE in the 1990s. (Colchester & Colchester, 2005) Changes in agricultural practices, such as the use of animal byproducts in feed or the intensification of livestock farming, may also increase the risk of prion disease transmission.(Nodelijk et al., 2011)
Despite extensive research efforts, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the conversion of PrPC to PrPSC and the subsequent neurodegeneration remain elusive. This lack of understanding has hindered the development of effective diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions for these devastating diseases. To address this critical knowledge gap, the molecular details of PrPSC misfolding and aggregation are modeled using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations with ClusPro(Kozakov et al., 2017), a protein docking software suite hosted by Boston University and Stony Brook University. Such simulations have emerged as a powerful tool for studying the dynamic behavior of biomolecules in solution, providing valuable insights into their folding and misfolding processes. By employing docking simulations, I can model the lowest energy, i.e., most stable state of interaction between two proteins, and identify what effects mutations such as the ones that lead to the development of a TSE. The information gleaned from the simulations will serve as a foundation for subsequent phenomenological modeling of PrPSC aggregation, the hallmark effect of prion diseases that leads to the destruction of brain tissue and the characteristic "spongiform" appearance.
This research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the structural transitions involved in the pathogenesis and proliferation of prion diseases. By investigating the molecular mechanisms of prion protein misfolding and aggregation in the context of the changing environmental and societal factors, this work aims to provide insights into the potential risks and drivers of the rise of TSEs in human populations. Ultimately, this project represents how a step towards understanding the complex interplay between prion diseases, the environment, and human health might be taken.
2 Methods
2.1 Obtaining the structure of the normal prion protein
The structure of the normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (www.rcsb.org). The PDB ID for the human prion protein is 1QLZ, which is a high-resolution (2.0 Å) NMR structure of the globular domain of human PrPC (residues 125-228). This structure was downloaded in PDB format for further analysis and manipulation.
2.2 Introducing mutations to generate the TSE form
The pathogenic isoform of the prion protein (PrPSC) associated with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) was generated by introducing specific mutations into the PrPC structure using the PyMOL molecular visualization system (version 2.4, Schrödinger, LLC). The following mutations were introduced to convert PrPC to PrPSC:
•	Substitution of valine at position 129 with methionine (V129M)
•	Substitution of glutamic acid at position 200 with lysine (E200K)
•	Substitution of aspartic acid at position 178 with asparagine (D178N) 
These mutations were selected based on their known association with familial prion diseases, such as familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (fCJD) and fatal familial insomnia (FFI).
 
2.3 Protein-protein docking using ClusPro
 
To investigate the interactions between the normal and mutant prion proteins, protein-protein docking simulations were performed using the ClusPro web server (https://cluspro.org). The following docking pairs were simulated:
•	Normal PrPC - Normal PrPC
•	Mutant PrPSC - Mutant PrPSC
•	Normal PrPC - Mutant PrPSC 
For each docking pair, the PDB files of the respective proteins were uploaded to the ClusPro server, and the docking calculations were performed using the default settings. ClusPro generates a series of potential docking conformations ranked by their docking scores, which consider factors such as shape complementarity, electrostatic interactions, and desolvation energy. For each docking pair, the best-scoring complex was selected based on the ClusPro docking scores. These top-ranked complexes represent the most probable conformations of the protein-protein interactions and were used for further analysis.
2.4 Analyzing the complexes using PRODIGY
To assess the stability and binding affinity of the docking complexes, the PRODIGY (PROtein binDIng enerGY prediction) tool was employed. PRODIGY is a web server that predicts the binding affinity of protein-protein complexes based on their structural features and intermolecular contacts. The PDB files of the best-scoring complexes obtained from ClusPro were submitted to the PRODIGY server (https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/prodigy/), and the calculations were performed using the default parameters. PRODIGY provides the predicted binding affinity in terms of the dissociation constant (Kd) and the free energy of binding (ΔG). These values were recorded for each complex (normal-normal, mutant-mutant, and normal-mutant) to compare their relative stabilities and binding strengths.
2.5 Estimation of key parameters
Methods:

2.5.1. Model Development:
A mathematical model based on the nucleated polymerization mechanism to describe the kinetics of prion protein aggregation was developed: The model consists of a system of three ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that represent the changes in the concentrations of normal prion protein (X), aggregated prion protein (Z), and the number of aggregates (Y) over time. The model incorporates the key processes of the NPM such as protein synthesis, degradation, aggregation, and fragmentation.
The ODEs are:
-	dX/dt = α + γ * n₀ * (n₀ - 1) * Y - 2 * β * X * Y - μ * X
-	dY/dt = γ * Z - (2 * n₀ - 1) * γ * Y - μ * Y
-	dZ/dt = 2 * β * X * Y - γ * n₀ * (n₀ - 1) * Y - μ * Z
where:
•	α is the healthy protein synthesis rate (μM/week)
•	μ is the protein degradation rate (1/week)
•	β is the aggregate conversion rate (μM⁻¹/week)
•	γ is the aggregate fragmentation rate (1/week)
•	n₀ is the minimum nucleus size (number of monomers)

2.5.2 Parameter Estimation:
To estimate the model parameters, I generated synthetic data using estimated parameter values based on the length of disease progression (α_true, μ_true, β_true, γ_true) and the `generate_data` function. This function solves the system of ODEs using the `solve_ivp` function from the SciPy library, given initial conditions for X and Z, and returns the concentrations of X and Z over time.
Then an objective function that calculates the sum of squared differences between the synthetic data and the model results was generated using a set of parameter estimates. The `minimize` function from the SciPy library was used to find the best-fitting parameters by minimizing the objective function. The L-BFGS-B optimization algorithm was employed, with bounds to ensure non-negative parameter values.

2.5.3. Model Simulation:
After obtaining the estimated parameters, I defined the system of ODEs in the `deriv` function, which takes the current concentrations of X, Y, and Z, along with the model parameters, and returns the time derivatives of these variables.
I set the initial conditions for X, Y, and Z based on the assumptions of the model and the estimated parameters. The initial concentration of aggregated prion protein (Z0) and the number of aggregates (Y0) were set to 0.001 μM, while the initial concentration of healthy monomers (X0) was calculated based on the steady-state assumption in the absence of aggregates.
The `odeint` function from the SciPy library was used to solve the system of ODEs numerically over a time range of 1000 weeks, generating the concentrations of X, Y, and Z at each time point.
2.5.4. Model Analysis:
The basic reproduction number (R₀) of the system was calculated using the estimated parameters. R₀ is a key threshold parameter that determines whether the aggregation process will persist or die out. If R₀ > 1, the aggregation process will persist, while if R₀ < 1, it will die out.
2.5.5. Visualization:
Finally, I plotted the concentrations of healthy monomers (X), aggregated prion protein (Z), and the number of aggregates (Y) over time using the Matplotlib library. The plots provide a visual representation of the model results and help in understanding the dynamics of prion protein aggregation.
Results
The PRODIGY analysis of the docking complexes revealed the following binding affinities and dissociation constants:
Normal PrPC - Normal PrPC complex: 
•	Free energy of binding (ΔG): -12.4 kcal/mol
•	Dissociation constant (Kd): 8 × 10⁻¹⁰ M
Normal PrPC - Mutant PrPSC complex: 
•	ΔG: -13.0 kcal/mol
•	Kd: 3.1 × 10⁻¹⁰ M
Mutant PrPSC - Mutant PrPSC complex: 
•	ΔG: -12.2 kcal/mol
•	Kd: 1.0 × 10⁻⁹ M
The PRODIGY results provide insight into the relative stabilities and binding affinities of the different prion protein complexes. The negative values of the free energy of binding (ΔG) indicate that the formation of these complexes is thermodynamically favorable and spontaneous.
Comparing the binding affinities, the Normal PrPC - Mutant PrPSC complex exhibits the lowest ΔG value (-13.0 kcal/mol) and the lowest Kd value (3.1 × 10⁻¹⁰ M), suggesting that this complex has the highest binding affinity and stability among the three analyzed complexes. This finding supports the hypothesis that the interaction between the normal and pathogenic isoforms of the prion protein may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. The high affinity of the normal-mutant complex may facilitate the recruitment of normal PrPC by the pathogenic PrPSC, leading to the conversion and accumulation of the misfolded protein.
The Normal PrPC - Normal PrPC complex also shows a relatively high binding affinity (ΔG = -12.4 kcal/mol, Kd = 8 × 10⁻¹⁰ M), indicating that the normal prion proteins can form stable dimers. This interaction may be important for the physiological function of PrPC, which is not yet fully understood.
Interestingly, the Mutant PrPSC - Mutant PrPSC complex has the lowest binding affinity among the three complexes (ΔG = -12.2 kcal/mol, Kd = 1.0 × 10⁻⁹ M). This suggests that the mutant prion proteins may have a lower tendency to self-associate compared to their interaction with the normal prion protein. However, it is important to note that the aggregation of PrPSC is a key event in prion diseases, and the lower binding affinity of the mutant-mutant complex does not necessarily imply a reduced pathogenicity. Other factors, such as the kinetics of aggregation and the stability of the resulting aggregates, may also contribute to the disease process.
The nucleated polymerization model was successfully implemented to simulate the kinetics of prion protein aggregation. The model parameters were estimated using synthetic data generated from known true values, and the best-fitting parameters were obtained through numerical optimization.
The estimated parameters were found to be:
•	Healthy protein synthesis rate (α): 0.02999684 μM/week
•	Protein degradation rate (μ): 0.00999548 /week
•	Aggregate conversion rate (β): 0.09999838 μM⁻¹/week
•	Aggregate fragmentation rate (γ): 0.00099958 /week

Using these estimated parameters, the basic reproduction number (R₀) of the system was calculated to be 2.86. This value indicates that the aggregation process is supercritical, meaning that it will persist and grow over time, as R₀ is greater than 1.
 
The model simulation results, obtained by solving the system of ODEs numerically, are presented in the plots above. The first plot shows the concentrations of normal prion protein and aggregated prion protein over time. Initially, the concentration of normal protein decreases rapidly as it is converted into aggregates. Simultaneously, the concentration of aggregated protein increases sharply. As the aggregation process continues, the concentration of normal protein reaches a steady state at a lower level, while the aggregated protein concentration plateaus at a higher level. The second plot depicts the concentration of healthy monomers over time. The concentration of healthy monomers follows a similar trend to that of the normal prion protein, decreasing rapidly in the early stages of the aggregation process and then reaching a steady state at a lower level.
These results demonstrate the ability of the nucleated polymerization model to capture the key features of prion protein aggregation kinetics. The model shows the conversion of normal prion protein into aggregates, the growth of aggregates over time, and the depletion of healthy monomers. The estimated parameters and the calculated R₀ value provide phenomenological insights into the underlying mechanisms driving the aggregation process. The model predictions are consistent with experimental observations of prion protein aggregation, where a rapid increase in aggregated protein is observed, accompanied by a decrease in normal protein. The plateauing of the concentrations at later times suggests that the system reaches an equilibrium state, balancing the processes of protein synthesis, degradation, aggregation, and fragmentation.
These results highlight the utility of mathematical modeling in understanding the complex dynamics of prion protein aggregation. The nucleated polymerization model, with its estimated parameters, provides a framework for further investigations into the mechanisms of prion diseases and the development of potential therapeutic strategies targeting the aggregation process.
Discussion:
The results of this work provide some limited insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of prion diseases. By combining molecular dynamics simulations, protein docking, and phenomenological modeling, I have gained a deeper understanding of the misfolding and aggregation processes that lead to the formation of pathogenic prion protein aggregates.
The PRODIGY analysis of the docking complexes revealed that the interaction between the normal prion protein (PrPC) and the mutant, pathogenic form (PrPSC) exhibits the highest binding affinity among the studied complexes. This finding suggests that the recruitment of PrPC by PrPSC is a critical step in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. The high affinity of this interaction could facilitate the conversion of PrPC into the misfolded PrPSC form, leading to the accumulation of pathogenic aggregates in the brain and seeds for the NPM.
The nucleated polymerization model successfully captured the key features of prion protein aggregation kinetics, as demonstrated by the simulation results. The model shows the rapid conversion of normal prion protein into aggregates, the growth of aggregates over time, and the depletion of healthy monomers. The estimated parameters and the calculated basic reproduction number (R₀) provide quantitative insights into the factors driving the aggregation process.
The pathologies associated with prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), and Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), can be better understood in light of these findings. The accumulation of PrPSC aggregates in the brain leads to the formation of microscopic holes, resulting in the characteristic sponge-like appearance of the affected tissue. This damage to the brain tissue is responsible for the neurological symptoms observed in prion diseases, including cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and ultimately, death.
The NPM suggests that the formation of the initial oligomeric nuclei, composed of misfolded prion proteins, is a critical step in the aggregation process. Once these nuclei are formed, they can rapidly grow by recruiting and converting more PrPC molecules, leading to the formation of larger, more stable aggregates. This process may explain the progressive nature of prion diseases, where the accumulation of PrPSC aggregates leads to an increasing rate of neurodegeneration over time.
The role of mutations in the prion protein, such as M128V and D178N, can also be interpreted in the context of the NPM. These mutations have been shown to destabilize the native structure of PrPC and increase its propensity to misfold and aggregate; by altering the kinetics of prion protein folding, these mutations facilitate the formation of the initial nuclei and accelerate the aggregation process, leading to progression of the disease.
The insights gained from this study have important implications for the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions for prion diseases. The identification of key molecular interactions, such as the high-affinity binding between PrPC and PrPSC, may provide targets for the development of drugs that could inhibit the conversion and aggregation of prion proteins. Additionally, the NPM could serve as a framework for the design of therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing the formation of the initial oligomeric nuclei or reducing the stability of existing aggregates.
This work demonstrates the power of combining molecular dynamics simulations, protein docking, and phenomenological modeling to investigate the complex mechanisms underlying prion diseases. The results provide a deeper understanding of the aggregation process that leads to the formation of pathogenic prion protein aggregates and the associated disease pathologies.
